# heart_stroke_prediction_python
using Healthcare data to predict stroke
1. 	Read dataset then  pre-processed it along with handing missing values and outlier.
2 Performed Univariate and Bivariate Analysis to draw key insights.
3.	Split dataset for training and testing purposes, implemented Ordinal Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to the columns which required.
4.	Used Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Classification, Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict Heart-Stroke.
5.	Compared each model performances on basis of Confusion and Classification Metrics and ROC Curve.
